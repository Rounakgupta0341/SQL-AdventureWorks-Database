--Employee Chek IN and check out Calculation
--To meet the company's requirements, need to calculate the total work hours of employees in a day based on their check-in and check-out times.

--In the SQL project I developed, the primary goal was to create a system that accurately tracks and calculates the total work hours of employees based on their check-in and check-out times. This project is essential for companies looking to streamline attendance management and ensure precise records of employee work hours.

--The process begins with the creation of an EmployeeWorkLog table that records each employee's check-in and check-out times. Using SQL queries, the project identifies the first check-in and the last check-out for each employee on a given day, which are crucial for calculating total work hours. The FirstCheckIn and LastCheckOut common table expressions (CTEs) isolate these critical timestamps for each employee.

--To handle scenarios where employees may check in and out multiple times in a day, the project includes a WorkSessions CTE, which pairs each check-in with the subsequent check-out. This ensures that the system accurately captures all work periods. The TotalOutCount CTE tracks the number of check-outs, providing an additional layer of verification to ensure all work sessions are accounted for.

--Finally, the TotalWorkHours CTE calculates the total work minutes by summing the duration of each work session, converting these minutes into a standard hours and minutes format. The final SELECT statement compiles all the relevant data, including the first check-in, last check-out, total check-outs, and total work hours for each employee.

--This SQL project not only meets the company's requirements for accurate work hour calculation but also provides a robust solution that can handle various attendance scenarios, ensuring reliable and efficient workforceÂ management.
